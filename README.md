# Car Dealer App

This is a simple Next.js application that allows users to filter vehicles by make and model year. The app fetches data from an external API and displays the results on a separate page.

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
